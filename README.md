> ##  <b>TASK #1: Prediction Using Supervised ML.</b>
- <b>Predict the Percentage Score of  students based on the no. of study hours/day. </b>
- <b>Dataset:</b> http://bit.ly/w-data
<br>

>## **Task #2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML.**
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters 
and represent it visually. 
- Dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
<br>

>## **Task #3: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm.**
- Create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
- The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
